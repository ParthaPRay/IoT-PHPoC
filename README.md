This book is all about a new technology called PHPoC and its use in the IoT ecosystem. This book aims to provide the hands-on and practical experience about the PHPoC which is combination of embedded hardware and PHP programming language. The chapters of the IoT provides detailed understanding about the working and structure of PHPoC for application development in IoT. In-depth discussions are incorporated to provide working knowledge about the PHPoC IoT boards, PHPoC IoT gateways, and PHPoC IoT modules. Moreover, PHPoC Debugger is presented in a detailed manner to help readers to program and debug PHPoC the technology enabled boards. Further, PHPoC library reference is appended along with the language centric discussion behind the PHPoC and some key use cases in IoT. This book can be suitable for a wide range of learners belonging to engineering disciplines, entrepreneurs, and researchers to ease the IoT-based product development process. Contents : 1. Basics of PHPoC 2. PHPoC IoT Board 3. PHPoC IoT Module 4. PHPoC IoT Gateways 5. PHPoC Debugger 6. PHPoC Language 7. PHPoC Library Reference 8. IoT Use Cases
